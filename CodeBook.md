A complement to the script run_analysis.R

### Step 00

Download the source data files https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip the pack into the working directory.

Read project relevant files into the following objects:

subject_train: data frame, 7352 observations for the training data set and one variable with participant number. x_train: data frame, 7352 observations and 561 quantitative variables for the training data set measurements. y_train: data frame, 7352 observations for the training data set activity numbers. subject_test: data frame, 2947 observations for the testing data set and one variable with participant number. x_test: data frame, 2947 and 561 quantitative variables for the testing data set measurements. y_test: data frame, 2947 observations for the testing data set activity numbers. features: data frame, 561 observations for the quantitative variables names.

### Step 01

Merge training and test data frames to create a new merged object.

merged: data frame, 10299 observations and 563 variables including 2 qualitative for activity and participant number and 561 quantitative for measurements.

### Step 02

Extract observations for the mean and the standard deviation variables to create a new subset object.

merged_subset: data frame, 10299 observations and 68 variables including 2 qualitative for activity and participant number and 66 quantitative for mean and standard deviation measurements.

### Step 03

Rename activity numbers with names.

Walking for 1. Walking Upstairs for 2. Walking Downstairs for 3. Sitting for 4. Standing for 5. Laying for 6.

### Step 04

Replace abbreviations with full words for the quantitative variables names.

Acc with Accelerometer. Mag with Magnitude. Gyro with Gyroscope. ^t with time. ^f with frequency.

### Step 05

Summarize averages for the mean and the standard deviation by activity and participant, subject, into a tidy data set.

tidy_data: data frame, 180 observations and 68 variables including 2 qualitative for activity and participant number and 66 quantitative for mean and standard deviation measurements.

### Step 06

Write the tidy object into the Tidy.text file deliverable.
