## Tidying up Activity Data

A complement to the script run_analysis.R

### The Tidying up Script: Steps. Objects Created. Variables Description

#### Step 00

Download the source data files https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip the pack into the working directory.

Read project relevant files into the following objects:

* subject_train: data frame, 7352 observations for the training data set and one variable with participant number.
* x_train: data frame, 7352 observations and 561 quantitative variables for the training data set measurements.
* y_train: data frame, 7352 observations for the training data set activity numbers.
* subject_test: data frame, 2947 observations for the testing data set and one variable with participant number.
* x_test: data frame, 2947 and 561 quantitative variables for the testing data set measurements.
* y_test: data frame, 2947 observations for the testing data set activity numbers. 
* features: data frame, 561 observations for the quantitative variables names.

More details on the content of the original dataset on README.txt.

#### Step 01

Merge training and test data frames to create a new merged object.

merged: data frame, 10299 observations and 563 variables including 2 qualitative for activity and participant number and 561 quantitative for measurements.

#### Step 02

Extract observations for the mean and the standard deviation variables to create a new subset object.

merged_subset: data frame, 10299 observations and 68 variables including 2 qualitative for activity and participant number and 66 quantitative for mean and standard deviation measurements.

#### Step 03

Rename activity numbers with names.

Walking for 1. Walking Upstairs for 2. Walking Downstairs for 3. Sitting for 4. Standing for 5. Laying for 6.

#### Step 04

Replace abbreviations with full words for the quantitative variables names.

Acc with Accelerometer. Mag with Magnitude. Gyro with Gyroscope. ^t with time. ^f with frequency.

#### Step 05

Summarize averages for the mean and the standard deviation by activity and participant, subject, into a tidy data set.

tidy_data: data frame, 180 observations and 68 variables including 2 qualitative for activity and participant number and 66 quantitative for mean and standard deviation measurements.

#### Step 06

Write the tidy object into the Tidy.text file deliverable.

### The Tidy Dataset

The tidy dataset includes 180 observations of 68 variables.

Two qualitative variables.

"Activity‚Äù: Activity label.
"ParticipantNumber" : Identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Sixty six quantitative variables corresponding to averages for standardized measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
